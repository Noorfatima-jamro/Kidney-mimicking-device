Kidney-Mimicking Device
Overview
The Kidney-Mimicking Device is an innovative project aimed at developing a portable, artificial kidney that replicates the essential functions of a natural kidney. The device is designed to provide patients with chronic kidney disease an alternative to traditional dialysis machines, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. By incorporating advanced filtration technologies and biocompatible materials, our goal is to enhance the quality of life for patients while minimizing the impact of renal failure on their daily activities.

Features
Biocompatible Materials: Constructed with materials that are safe for human use to minimize adverse reactions.
Continuous Filtration: Designed to continuously filter blood, mimicking the natural function of kidneys without the need for long dialysis sessions.
Portable Design: Lightweight and easy to carry, allowing patients to maintain an active lifestyle while receiving treatment.
Real-time Monitoring: Integrated sensors to monitor key parameters such as blood flow, pressure, and chemical levels.
User-friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for patients to interact with the device, including alerts for maintenance and performance.
Components
Biocompatible Materials: Silicone, polyurethane, PMMA, and titanium for structural integrity and safety.
Membrane Filtration: Use of polymeric and ceramic membranes for efficient filtration of blood.
Sensors: Flow sensors, pressure sensors, and chemical sensors for monitoring.
Microcontrollers: Arduino or Raspberry Pi for managing device operations.
Power Supply: Lithium-ion batteries for portable power.
Casing/Enclosure: Durable plastics or metals to protect internal components.
Software: Embedded programming for sensor management and data processing.
Installation and Usage
Setup: Place the device on a stable surface. Ensure all connections are secure.
Powering On: Connect the device to a power source or ensure that the battery is charged.
User Interface: Follow the prompts on the screen to begin the filtration process.
Monitoring: Regularly check the interface for alerts or updates regarding device performance.
Maintenance: Follow the maintenance guidelines provided in the user manual.
Future Development
The Kidney-Mimicking Device is still in the prototype phase. Future developments will focus on:

Improving filtration efficiency and speed.
Expanding compatibility with various patient needs.
Conducting clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy.
Exploring additional features such as remote monitoring and data logging.
